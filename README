Django REST API Example

Goals:

   - demonstrate creation of REST API with Django REST Framework

Assignment:

    Build API endpoints to create, update, delete and retrieve information about providers:

       - Name
       - Email
       - Phone Number
       - Language
       - Currency

    Each provider should have area of business operation. The provider should be able to define its service area. Build API endpoint to create, update, delete and get a polygon. A polygon should contain a name and price as well as the geojson information.

    Create API endpoint to query provider areas. It should take a lat/lng pair as arguments and return a list of all polygons that include the given lat/lng. The name of the polygon, provider's name, and price should be returned for each polygon. This operation should be fast.

    Deploy the code to a Docker hosting provider.
